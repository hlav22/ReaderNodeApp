Application using Fast CSV 
The Main Branch allows the application to run locally. You add whatever file and the application will format it into JSON format.
The Second Branch is what I am currently working on for AWS Cloud Services. This will trigger the function with a S3 put, and format the data into JSON for a Data Base.
Second branch is me wrapping the application into lambda, and configuring the data with the bucket/permissions that come with the S3 Put.
